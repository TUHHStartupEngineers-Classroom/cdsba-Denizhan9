2. chatbotTRUE: The estimated change in purchase_amount when chatbot is TRUE compared to when it is FALSE. A negative coefficient suggests that the presence of a chatbot is associated with a decrease in purchase_amount.


3. The CATE for mobile users (chatbotTRUE:mobile_deviceTRUE)is -0.06455 in the model. However, this coefficient is not statistically significant, indicating that there is no significant distinction in the impact of the chatbot on sales (purchase_amount) between mobile and non-mobile users.

4. Coefficient for chatbotTRUE in the logistic regression model is -0.96894. Therefore:

A negative coefficient suggests that the presence of the chatbot is associated with a decrease in the log-odds of making a purchase compared to when the chatbot is not present. It implies that customers exposed to the chatbot are less likely to make a purchase (purchase = 1) compared to those not exposed, according to the model.
